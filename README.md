Contains 3 slightly different mazes to choose from.

Upon choosing one, after every 5 seconds a dwarf spawns as the arrow characters (↑ ↓ → ←)

One only follows the left wall
One only follows the right wall
One teleports to the end after a random amount of time
And the last one uses the A* pathfinding algorithm to find his way straight to the finish

After all of them reach the end, the program ends.
